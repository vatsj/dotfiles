# dotfiles
my dotfiles for *nix systems

## Philosophy
This repo contains the dotfiles I ([Jacob](https://vatsj.github.io/)) use on *nix machines, as well as an install.sh script for setup.
- The dotfiles are kept minimal, including only commands I think our necessary and relying on the software's presets as much as possible.
- The install script adds symlinks to a target directory (`~` by default)

## Installation
- clone the repo to gain access to the dotfiles
- run `???` to symlink files to target directory (`~` by default)

To uninstall, just delete the symlinks
